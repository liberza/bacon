# bacon - Balloon Ascent Controller

The goal of this project is to control the rate of ascent of two high-altitude
balloons, to keep at the same relative altitude as they ascend. 

A simulator is included in simulator/. Run sim.py to start, then power up the
two payloads to begin auto-discovery. Once that is finished, the simulated
flight begins and shows a live plot of progress.
